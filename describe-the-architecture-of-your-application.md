# Describe the architecture of your application

Break down your application to describe the architecture - for evaluating your LLM App specifically, there’s no need to get too deep into the weeds, just make sure you track:

* Where you are retrieving data from (consider external websites, databases, vector databases etc)
* The flow and storage of data if you’re fine-tuning a model
* The flow and storage of data if you’re building your own foundational model
* Any external API calls you make
* Any code execution capabilities you make
* Any caching mechanisms
* Anything that gets stored by a user

Here's an example
