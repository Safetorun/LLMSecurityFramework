# Random Sequence Enclosure

This defence is used in combination with XML encapsulation. The user's input is encapsulated in XML tags, and the tag is randomised. This is a strong defence because it makes it harder for an attacker to escape the XML tags, and it provides a simple way to scan for a a unique identifier to the user's input.
