# The 4 step process

1. Describe the architecture of your application - include where user (or attacker) input comes in, where it is rendered, any storage used by the LLM (e.g. for RAG), training data, fine-tuning data, ‘memory’ or caching mechanisms and any external data sources&#x20;
2. Walk through the flow-chart to understand risk factors, outputs and attack vectors - add them to your diagram as you go&#x20;
3. Add each ‘risk’ to your diagram and understand the applicability of each one&#x20;
4. Apply your defences to ensure you are mitigating all risks&#x20;
